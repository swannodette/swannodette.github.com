It's been a very exciting year for ClojureScript. It's clear that things
have been accelerating and here is a personal selection of highlights:

## CLJSJS

While technically it appeared in late 2014,
[CLJSJS](http://cljsjs.github.io) took off when ClojureScript landed
enhanced and standardized support for foreign dependencies in
January. Thanks to the tireless work of many contributors, the wider
community of ClojureScript users can now leverage the most popular
JavaScript libraries with minimal hassle. Many thanks to Martin Klepsch
and Juho Teperi for leading the charge.

## Ambly

2015 kicked off with a near complete rewrite of the ClojureScript REPL
infrastructure. This was an admittedly painful transition, but now
that we are on the other side of the hump the considerable payoff is
self-evident.

Case in point, Mike Fikes's
[Ambly REPL](https://github.com/omcljs/ambly) delivers a seamless live
experience when developing iOS applications without requiring
tethering or XCode beyond the initial install. Using a slick
combination of Bonjour and WebDAV, the Ambly REPL sets a new bar.

Here's a basic Ambly demo:

Ambly plays well with other cool JavaScriptCore integrations like
[Ejecta](https://github.com/phoboslab/ejecta) which exposes both
JavaScript Canvas 2D and WebGL APIs to native iOS clients.

For example here's Ambly being used to develop an Ejecta application
on [tvOS](https://developer.apple.com/tvos/?&cid=wwa-us-kwg-tv):

## React Native

Facebook announced
[React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) further
solidifying the role of React as a critical part of the ClojureScript
ecosystem. ClojureScript React bindings abound and now the community
can easily reach the iOS and Android platforms using the same React
bindings we've all come to love over the past two years.

Here is another Mike Fikes video demonstrating React Native with
Reagent:

For getting up and running with React Native, look at
[natal](https://github.com/dmotz/natal) and
[re-natal](https://github.com/drapanjanas/re-natal) as well as the
collection of resources at [cljsrn.org](http://cljsrn.org/).

Suffice to say I see ClojureScript + React Native really taking off
in 2016.

## Google Summer of Code

The ClojureScript Google Summer of Code 2015 project was a smashing
success. Maria Geller dove deep into the problem of integrating
CommonJS, AMD, ES2015 modules as well as integrating popular
JavaScript compilation technology like Babel.js. There's more work to
do but the future is bright for good integration with the wider
JavaScript ecosystem. You can read more about the project
[here](http://mneise.github.io).

Also Maria Geller gave a stunning talk about the ClojureScript
compiler internals at the Clojure/conj which is
[well worth watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elg17s_nwDg).

## Re-frame

[Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) has become the
tool of choice for many people in the ClojureScript community. My
uninformed impression is that this has been further bolstered by the
appearance of [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame), a very
well-considered architecture for Reagent applications.

If the other ClojureScript React bindings aren't your speed, Reagent
and re-frame invite close assessment. The community is prolific,
active, and helpful.

## Figwheel

While [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) appeared
prior to 2015, it became clear with a slew of strong stable releases
that, Bruce Hauman is one of ClojureScript's finest tooling
authors. In a very short window of time Figwheel has taken the
ClojureScript world by storm as the REPL of choice. The usefulness of
hot-code loading during UI work cannot be overstated.

This video should be watched in its entirety:

allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Devcards

Clearly Figwheel wasn't enough for
Bruce. [Devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) sets a new bar
for UI tooling. Devcards also came together prior to 2015 but the
adoption rate has skyrocketed of late and for good reason. Having
tried all kinds of UI tooling in my career, Devcards legitimately provides
something so obvious and simple it's incredible it hasn't been tried
before. As Alan Kay says, a change of perspective is worth a
non-trivial amount of IQ points.

Combined with Figwheel, Devcards provides an interactive way to both
develop and view component states, radically simplifying the task of
testing your UI work:

Again, this video must be watched in its entirety:

## Self Compilation

With the appearance of reader conditionals in Clojure 1.7.0 I got the
bug over the summer to make ClojureScript self compile. While it may
seem like a feat to outsiders, ClojureScript was always ready for
self compilation and the work was pretty boring. The repercussions
however are only starting to be understood. Some great examples of the
power of optional bootstrapping are the winning
[Clojure Cup entry](http://landofquil.we-do-fp.berlin) and a new
web based [ClojureScript REPL](http://clojurescript.io).

Some other neat bootstrapping projects follow after some brief words
on ClojureScript 1.7.X.

## ClojureScript 1.7.X

Shortly after bootstrapping we released ClojureScript 1.7.28. This was
the first release of ClojureScript with a proper version number. It
also signified a much slower pace for releases, much needed to avoid
tooling churn. Now that the fundamentals are in place expect 2016 releases
to be heavily focused on compiler performance and build
reliability. Master already includes exciting enhancements like
parallel builds (40 lines of code written during a 45 minute train
ride - thanks Clojure!). Users have reported 30-300% faster compile
times on their multi-core machines.

## Planck

Mike Fikes is clearly a tireless person, within what seemed like hours
of bootstrapping, Mike Fikes had a standalone ClojureScript REPL that
you can easily install with [brew](http://brew.sh).

<iframe style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 2px;" width="580" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CC5jGO712cE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If you want a ClojureScript REPL that starts fast for testing one
liners, look no further than Planck.

## Replete

Thanks to bootstrapping you can also use full blown ClojureScript on
your iPhone or iPad:

src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GVVugX3qqF8" frameborder="0"
allowfullscreen></iframe>

If you had told me I would be running a robust dialect of Clojure on my
iOS device four years ago I would have laughed in disbelief.

## Parinfer

This one came out of the blue. Lisp is 58 years old and people are
still coming up with things that no one has tried before. With a
clever algorithm and some inference driven by indentation, Shaun
LeBron of [cljs.info](http://cljs.info) has probably created the most
beginner friendly way to write Lisp the world has ever seen. The
[parinfer blog post is a jaw dropper](https://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/).

And of course Mike Fikes gets parinfer into Replete in short order:

allowfullscreen></iframe>

If anything 2015 has been the year of network effects. It's thrilling
to see all these individual efforts come together as part of a grand
shared vision.

## Cursive

[Cursive IDE shipped](https://cursive-ide.com/)! If you're looking for
a rich development environment for Clojure and ClojureScript, Cursive
delivers in spades. I've been using it exclusively for Clojure and
ClojureScript development since January and I can't imagine life without
it.

## Cider 0.10

[Cider 0.10](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v0.10.0)
shipped with many, many enhancements for ClojureScript. If Emacs is
your tool of choice, the ClojureScript story has improved leaps and
bounds over the past year thanks to the tireless work of many
contributors.

## Om Next

I also did a series of talks on Om Next this year. Whether or not you
adopt Om or the technologies that inspired it
([Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/),
[Falcor](http://netflix.github.io/falcor/),
[Datomic](http://datomic.com)), I am confident that Graph-Query-View
based UI architectures will gain steam in 2016. Kovas Boguta and I
gave a
[high level talk at QCon](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/domain-driven-architecture)
and I delivered the
[nitty gritty at Clojure/conj](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDZpSIngwm4).

## Conclusion

The amount of innovation and invention in the ClojureScript community
is nothing short of stunning. Hopefully this post gives you a sense of
what sets ClojureScript apart from pretty much every other
compile-to-JavaScript technology. As a group we are now thinking
far beyond programming language esoterica and have turned towards the
challenge of building the necessary *environmental infrastructure*
required for the construction of simpler and more robust software
systems.

Congratulations to all that have given to the evolution of
ClojureScript whether through adoption, contribution, or evangelism!

I suspect 2016 will be an even bigger one for ClojureScript.

Have a Happy New Year!
