*Disclaimer: I am an employee of Cognitect and I worked on the
 [transit-js](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-js) implementation. The
 opinions found herein are my own and do not necessarily reflect the
 recommendations or views of Cognitect.*

By now you may have heard of something called
[Transit](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/7/22/transit), a new format for
conveying values between heterogenous systems. Transit seemed to generate a lot
of interest, but given many of the comments on the announcement
post and elsewhere like [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8069346), it seems that
people may be unclear about the value proposition.

Admittedly this state of affairs is not entirely the fault of the audience. I've
had the pleasure of using software designed under the guidance of [Rich
Hickey](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) for seven years
now. Often his design decisions cover nuanced territory with far more dimensions
than can be communicated in a short introduction. I'll try here to illuminate
some properties of Transit that I think might easily be overlooked. We'll make
some of these points concrete via an example in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
([Ruby](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-ruby),
[Python](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-ruby),
[Java](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-ruby), and
[Clojure](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-ruby) work just as well). We'll
communicate with client-side JavaScript, but you can use whatever compile-to-JavaScript
language you prefer.

But before we do any of that, let's first address something that appeared with
surprising frequency following the announcement - *"Why not use existing data format X
instead?"*. This kept getting asked even though the third sentence of the
announcement post read:

> *JSON currently dominates similar use cases*, but it has a limited set of types,
> no extensibility, and is verbose. Actual applications of JSON are rife with ad
> hoc and context-dependent workarounds for these limitations, yielding coupled
> and fragile programs.

Yet people continued to enumerate existing formats which do not actually compete
in the same design space as JSON. If you only use a binary data format to convey
values in your heterogenous system, you are unlikely to be the target consumer of
Transit. However, if some components of your system marshal JSON and you would
prefer something comparable in performance to JSON when communicating with those
components, then Transit is well worth thinking long and hard about.

As to why transit-js doesn't yet use the binary [msgpack](http://msgpack.org)
encoding, benchmarking has shown that existing binary formats don't yet compete
with JSON in many JavaScript environments (see footnote (1) at the end of the
post). Currently transit-js compares quite favorably to plain old JSON (see
footnote (2)).

Let's consider a typical API result, for example the [JSON response from
Twitter's search api](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/search/tweets):

```js
{
  "statuses": [
    {
      "coordinates": null,
      "favorited": false,
      "truncated": false,
      "created_at": "Mon Sep 24 03:35:21 +0000 2012", // SAD PANDA
      "id_str": "250075927172759552",
      ...
      "in_reply_to_user_id": null,
      "place": null,
      "user": {
        "profile_sidebar_fill_color": "DDEEF6", // BOO
        "profile_sidebar_border_color": "C0DEED", // HOO
         ....
         "profile_image_url": "http://a0.twimg.com/...", // :( :( :(
         "created_at": "Mon Apr 26 06:01:55 +0000 2010", // ARGH!
         ...
         "profile_link_color": "0084B4", // RAGE!
         ...
      },
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Obviously we can represent strings and some numbers just fine with JSON - but
fields like `created_at`, `profile_image_url`, `profile_sidebar_fill_color`,
`profile_link_color`, etc. have lost their meaning. It's likely that this JSON
response was generated with `URI` and `DateTime` and `Color` instances in hand,
but on the wire they simply become strings. The receiver now must know which
parts of this response represents which values.

Contrast this to a transit-js value before encoding where `t` is the `transit`
library, `URI` is the constructor from the
[URIjs](http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/) library, `moment` is
[moment.js](http://momentjs.com), and `color` is
[onecolor](https://github.com/One-com/one-color):

```js
t.map([
  "statuses", [
    t.map([
      "coordinates", null,
      "favorited", false,
      "truncated", false,
      "created_at", moment("Mon Sep 24 03:35:21 +0000 2012"), // YAY!
      "id_str", "250075927172759552",
      ...
      "in_reply_to_user_id", null,
      "place", null,
      "user", t.map([
        "profile_sidebar_fill_color", color("DDEEF6"), // YIPPEE!
        "profile_sidebar_border_color", color("C0DEED"), // WOOT!
        ...
        "profile_image_url", URI("http://a0.twimg.com/..."), // HURRAH!
        "created_at", moment("Mon Apr 26 06:01:55 +0000 2010"), // WIN!
        ...
        "profile_link_color", color("0084B4"), // HALLELUJAH!
      ]),
      ...
    ]),
    ...
  ]
])
```

When this value is written out, Transit does not discard the important semantic
information needed to interpret this data upon arrival at the client. If we're
using JavaScript on the front and back end, it's simple to [share
handlers](http://github.com/swannodette/transit-js-example/blob/master/shared/handlers.js)
so that we get the same types in both places - ["isomorphic"
JavaScript](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/)
people.

Or, if you're writing Java, it's nice to know your [Joda Time
instances](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) become Moment instances on
the front end and so forth.

Now let's contrast using JSON versus using transit-js on the front end. Notice
below that in the case of transit-js the types are always the ones you expect: no need to
remember which date format or what color library was agreed upon. Just start
programming!

```js
(function(g) {
    var j   = g.jQuery,
        h   = g.transitHandlers,
        rdr = g.transit.reader("json", {handlers: h.readHandlers});

    // Reading transit, values are already the types your team expects
    // just start programming

    function parseTransitStatus(status) {
        var user = status.get("user");
        return {
            weekLater: status.get("created_at").add("days", 7),
            color: user.get("profile_sidebar_fill_color").cmyk(),
            url: user.get("profile_image_url").path()
        };
    };

    j.ajax({
        type: "GET",
        url: "transit",
        complete: function(res) {
            var data = rdr.read(res.responseText),
                xs   = data.get("statuses").map(parseTransitStatus);
            console.log(xs);
        }
    });

    // Reading JSON, you always need to remember exactly what to hydrate
    // to which types your team has agreed upon

    function parseJSONStatus(status) {
        var user = status["user"];
        return {
            weekLater: new Date(status["created_at"]).add("days", 7), // OOPS!!!
            color: user["profile_sidebar_fill_color"], // BLAST!
            url: URI(user["profile_image_url"]).path() 
        };
    }

    j.get("json", function(data) {
        var xs = data["statuses"].map(parseJSONStatus);
        console.log(xs);
    });

})(this);
```

With fast ES6-like maps and sets and user extensibility baked
in, you can transport values that best describe your application without chaining
yourself to the representational boundaries imposed by JSON.

But at what cost?

The transit-js version of the original Twitter payload is smaller and does not
take measurably longer to transmit to the client.

Here's a Chrome DevTools JavaScript profile to determine where our program is
spending its time. Note how far down the profile transit-js appears:

<img style="border: 1px solid #ccc" src="/assets/images/profile.png" />

What about Firefox?

<img style="border: 1px solid #ccc" src="/assets/images/ff_profile.png" />

If we dig in a bit more and check out the flame graph, we'll see something like
this:

<img style="border: 1px solid #ccc" src="/assets/images/flame.png" />

`V.j` is the call into transit-js. Note the self time. This means transit-js is
unlikely to be the bottleneck; rather, the bottleneck will be whatever
particular type you wish to hydrate with.

You can profile under Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer: the results
will be much the same.

You can find the [entire
example](http://github.com/swannodette/transit-js-example) shown here on GitHub.

If you'd like to play around with transit-js without installing Node.js, I
recommend taking a look at the [tour](http://cognitect.github.io/transit-tour).
